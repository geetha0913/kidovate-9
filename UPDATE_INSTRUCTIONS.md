## 🚀 How to Update Your Application

### Step 1: Update Database

You need to add the new `parent_kid_requests` table to your database.

**Option A: Run the full init script (if starting fresh)**
```bash
# In Neon SQL Editor, run:
server/config/init-db.sql
```

**Option B: Add only the new table (if database already exists)**

Go to **Neon Dashboard** → **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
-- Parent-Kid link requests table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parent_kid_requests (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  kid_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  parent_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'approved', 'rejected')) DEFAULT 'pending',
  requested_by VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (requested_by IN ('kid', 'parent')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(kid_id, parent_id)
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_parent_id ON users(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_parent_kid_requests_kid ON parent_kid_requests(kid_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_parent_kid_requests_parent ON parent_kid_requests(parent_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_parent_kid_requests_status ON parent_kid_requests(status);
```

### Step 2: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation 'parent_kid_requests' does not exist"

**Solution:** Make sure `server/routes/parentKid.js` file exists

### Error: "Cannot find module '../../components/ParentKidLink'"
**Solution:** Make sure both component files exist in `client/src/components/`

### Link button not showing
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Solution:** 
1. Ensure link request was approved
2. Kid must have some activity (complete a lesson first)
3. Refresh the page
